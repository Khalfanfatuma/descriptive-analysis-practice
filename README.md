# Summarizing Data ‚Äì Assignment Practice

This project is part of my ALX Data Analytics learning journey (Weeks 1 & 2).

## Dataset
The dataset contains qualifications by gender (male/female) across different fields.

## Tasks
- Calculated **totals** for each category
- Found **minimum** and **maximum** counts
- Summarized **number of qualifications**
- Explored descriptive statistics (frequency, central tendency, variability)

## Insights
- Humanities & Arts had the highest male participation (36).
- Health and Welfare showed a relatively balanced distribution (26 males vs 18 females).
- Engineering had **no female participants** in this sample.
- Minimum = 0, Maximum = 69 (combined counts).

## Skills Demonstrated
- Data summarization in spreadsheets
- Applying descriptive statistics
- Translating raw data into insights
